# Study-on-ChatGPT

A study on the capabilities of ChatGPT on correctly answering classroom assignments.


## Installation
You can install the latest version of this software directly from github with pip:

```pip install git+https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper```

This will install chatgpt-wrapper and it's dependencies. Before starting the program, you will need to install a browser in playwright (if you haven't already). The program will use firefox by default.

```playwright install firefox```

With that done, you should start up the program in install mode, which will open up a browser window.

```chatgpt install```

Log in to ChatGPT in the browser window, then stop the program. 

## Usage
From the terminal or IDE run ```__main__``` in the ```__init__.py``` of the src folder.
