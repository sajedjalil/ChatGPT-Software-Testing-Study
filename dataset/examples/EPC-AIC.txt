Question:
Suppose that coverage criterion C1 subsumes coverage criterion C2.
Further suppose that test set T1 satisfies C1 on program P, and test set T2 satisfies C2, also on P.
Does T1 necessarily satisfy C2? Explain.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ChatGPT:
T1 may or may not satisfy C2.
The fact that T1 satisfies C1, which subsumes C2, means that C1 is a more comprehensive criterion that includes all of the requirements of C2.
However, it does not guarantee that T1 will also satisfy C2. T1 may include test cases that are not necessary to satisfy C2,
and it may not include test cases that are necessary to satisfy C2.
Therefore, additional test cases may be needed to confirm that T1 also satisfies C2.

Verdict:
Understands what subsume means. But makes logical error in decision.
