Question:
"Consider the following three example classes. These are OO faults taken from Joshua Bloch’s
Effective Java, Second Edition. Answer the following questions about each.


class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public Point (int x, int y) {
        this.x=x; this.y=y;
    }

    @Override public boolean equals (Object o) {
    // Location A
        if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false;
        Point p = (Point) o;
        return (p.x == this.x) && (p.y == this.y);
    }
}

class ColorPoint extends Point {
    private Color color;
    // Fault: Superclass instantiable; subclass state extended
    public ColorPoint (int x, int y, Color color){
        super (x,y);
        this.color=color;
    }
    @Override public boolean equals (Object o){
    // Location B
        if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint)) return false;
        ColorPoint cp = (ColorPoint) o;
        return (super.equals(cp) && (cp.color == this.color));
    }
}

// Tests:
Point p = new Point (1,2);
ColorPoint cp1 = new ColorPoint (1,2,RED);
ColorPoint cp2 = new ColorPoint (1,2,BLUE);
p.equals (cp1); // Test 1: Result = true;
cp1.equals (p); // Test 2: Result = false;
cp1.equals (cp2); // Test 3: Result = false;
// Expected: p.equals (cp1) = true; cp1.equals (p) = true,
// cp1.equals (cp2) = false

If possible, give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly
explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter.

ChatGPT:
It is not possible to give a test case that results in an error but not a failure because the error in the given code is in the implementation of the equals method in the ColorPoint class, which does not properly check for equality of all relevant fields, including the color field, when comparing ColorPoint objects.
This will result in incorrect output, but will not cause the program to fail or throw an exception. The program will run and complete its execution successfully, with the exception of returning incorrect results.

The program counter continues to execute the next instruction, even if the output is not correct, so the program does not fail or raise an error.

In other words, the error in the given code is a semantic error, not a syntactic error or a runtime error.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Verdict:
The answer is correct because it is possible.

But the explanation is totally wrong.
It treated error as the same as an exception or crash.
But the book definition of error state varies.
