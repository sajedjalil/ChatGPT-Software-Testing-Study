Question:
When overriding the equals() method, programmers are also required to override the hashCode() method;
otherwise clients cannot store instances of these objects in common Collection structures such as HashSet.
For example, the Point class from Chapter 1 is defective in this regard.
Rewrite your JUnit test as an appropriate JUnit theory. Evaluate it with suitable DataPoints.

ChatGPT:
Here is an example of a JUnit theory test that demonstrates the relationship between the equals() and hashCode() methods in the Point class:

Copy code
import org.junit.experimental.theories.DataPoints;
import org.junit.experimental.theories.Theories;
import org.junit.experimental.theories.Theory;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotEquals;

@RunWith(Theories.class)
public class PointTheoryTest {
    @DataPoints
    public static Point[] points = {
        new Point(1, 2),
        new Point(3, 4),
        new Point(5, 6),
        new Point(7, 8)
    };

    @Theory
    public void testEqualsHashCodeContract(Point p1, Point p2) {
        if (p1.equals(p2)) {
            assertEquals(p1.hashCode(), p2.hashCode());
        } else {
            assertNotEquals(p1.hashCode(), p2.hashCode());
        }
    }
}
This test uses a JUnit theory to test the relationship between the equals() and hashCode() methods in the Point class. The test defines a set of data points, which are instances of the Point class, and uses these data points as input for the theory. The theory test the contract between equals and hashcode using the assertEquals and assertNotEquals methods. The test will run all the possible combinations of the point instances and will check the relationship between equals and hashcode.

It's important to remember that this is just one way to test the contract between equals() and hashCode() using JUnit theory and different scenarios might require different test cases.

Verdict:
- Did not check null points or points with similar values
- Lacks testing knowledge in terms of corner cases.
